# Tindog
Tindog is a traveling/dating platform for both dogs and owners.

## About
Sometimes, itâ€™s hard to take your dog on travel, renting a car is expensive, and cleaning the car afterwards is super painful as well.
So I start building this project that could put these owners together and take them out, with their dogs.

However, I ended up with a dating website that target dog owners. 
But the business model is still based on taking these dog owners on travel with their dogs.
