Tindog is a traveling/dating platform for both dogs and owners.

## About
Sometimes, itâ€™s hard to take your dog on travel, renting a car is expensive, and cleaning the car afterwards is super painful as well.

So I start building this project that could put these owners together and take them out, with their dogs.

However, I ended up with a dating website that target dog owners. But the business model is still based on taking these dog owners on travel with their dogs. 

## Initial Setup
To get started, first clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/dindean/Tindog.git`

Install NPM packages:  

`npm install`

To start Tindog in development mode, run
`npm run dev-mac`

and visit localhost:8080.
